this is a Remote Access trojan (RAT) in Java and created to run on windows machines. it works by establishing aconnection to its client 
app that the victim will activate clicking on its executable jar file that will be masked in a chrome tab.

#Functions 
This RAT Program can do the following:

• Gain access to a victim’s web camera 
• Capture a victim’s keystrokes  

#how to use
the hacker will have to download ecliplse or a similar Java Editor to build the .jar file for the client 
amd the server. After which he/she will distribute the client file to the unsuspectin victim. then once the victim runs the 
client program it will begin its cycles autmatically . there are are currently two cycles of functions which will be carried out then send them
to the server. the files fcan then be accessed in the respective folders in the server's directory.
