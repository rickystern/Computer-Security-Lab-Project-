# Computer-Security-Lab-Project-
This is a Remote Access trojan (RAT) in Java and created to run on windows machines. it works by establishing aconnection to its client 
app that the victim will activate clicking on its executable jar file that will be masked in a chrome tab. This application is strictly for the purpose of 
demonstration and the Authors take no responsibility for it's malicious use outside of the intended the scope of this project. 

#Functions 
This RAT Program can do the following:

• Gain access to a victim’s web camera 
• Capture a victim’s keystrokes  

#How to use
The hacker will have to download ecliplse or a similar Java Editor to build the .jar file for the client 
amd the server. After which he/she will distribute the client file to the unsuspectin victim, the executable pnce activated will open a chrome tab instance.
once open the client operation will have begun its cycles autmatically . there are are currently two cycles of functions which will be carried out.
Once the Client carries out its instructions it will transmit the data to the server which will then immediately be available to the acker.
These files can then be accessed in the respective folders in the server's storage directory.
